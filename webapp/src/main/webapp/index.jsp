<h1> Hello, Welcome to Simple DevOps Project !!   </h1>
<h2> Automated deploys to a Docker Container onto Docker Server via Jenkins and Ansible.  </h2>

<p> This container is being deployed via job "deploy-dockercontainer-on-dockerhost-using-ansible" on Jenkins.</p>
<p> It starts, via Poll SCM, with a Git push.  It then triggers on the Jenkins server, which connects
to the ansible server, and ansible deploys directly to the Docker server. </p>
